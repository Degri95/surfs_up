# surfs_up
Weather analysis using Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, and SQLalchemy.

## Overview of the analysis
In this analysis key statistics will be compared in Oâ€˜ahu, Hawaii's weather to help determine if a surf and icecream shop is sustainable year-round. Using a SQLite database, temperature information was extracted using SQLalchemy and converted into a Pandas DataFrame. After the DataFrames were created, I used a Pandas Dataframe method to generate summary statistics of the weather. The two months selected to analyze are June and December.
